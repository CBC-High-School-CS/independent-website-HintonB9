            <h3>About us</h3>
          <p> 
            Hi there, and welcome to Sports Gear Dictionairy!
            
            I'm Bryce, and I started this website as a school project with one goal in mind: to create a clear, easy-to-use dictionary for all kinds of sports gear. Whether you're just getting into a new sport or you're a lifelong athlete, I wanted to build a place where anyone could look up a piece of equipment and instantly understand it's history.
            
            What began as a simple assignment quickly turned into something much bigger. As someone who's always been passionate about sports and learning, I saw the potential to turn this project into a full-blown resource for players, fans, students, and curious minds everywhere.
            
            Sports Gear Dictionairy is constantly growing, and I'm always working on adding new entries, updating definitions, and making the site better. It's not just about gear—it's about helping people connect with the sports they love by understanding the tools that make them possible.
            
            Thanks for stopping by—and if you have suggestions, corrections, or gear you'd like to see added, feel free to reach out!
            
            — Bryce
